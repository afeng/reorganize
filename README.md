# REorganize
Built by Amber Feng

REorganize is a small Javascript app (more like a widget, actually) to help you reorganize the furniture in your room. You can set the dimensions of your room, create different sized boxes to represent your bed, desk, etc. and drag them around to see how to best arrange your room. 

REorganize is built primarily using JQuery's draggable/droppable functionality. For more details on how parts of REorganize was built using JQuery, see this [article](http://www.amberonrails.com/jquery-draggable-and-droppable/).
